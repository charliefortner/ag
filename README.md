# Corn, Soybeans, and Hog Bellies
Agricultural price and production data from the USDA's [Statistical Service](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/). I've dropped columns I thought were un-needed and dropped all rows where the commodity values were null.

Original data downloaded from here: ftp://ftp.nass.usda.gov/quickstats/

Column definitions are here: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api. Explanation of some indicators in the data set are in the [glossary](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/src/glossary.pdf)
